      <p>Hi, I'm Valjean. I live in San Francisco.</p>
      <p>
        I work in software. I love developer tools, design systems, maps, and
        really any problem space that has challenging UI/UX problems (e.g. data
        visualization, complex workflows, streaming data).
      </p>
      <p>
        I spend a lot of time in the mountains. Recently I've been spending more
        time off-trail. I also enjoy cycling, particularly gravel.
