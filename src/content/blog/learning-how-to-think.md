My college required that I take a set of three humanities courses. I'll never forget the third course, which was focused on United States history, because of what I learned from the professor.

The course was a mix between an English course that focused on writing assignments and a history course that required reading textbooks and novels relevant to the period of history we were studying. I had a pretty good formula for this kind of assignment: read, summarize, use good grammar, get the A.

I remember the shock I felt after seeing the grade for the first assignment: C-. Impossible! My grammar was correct and my summarizations accurate. What happened?

I saw the professor after class to ask him about it. He told me that while my grammar was indeed correct and I had met the word count requirement, I hadn't written anything of depth. At first, I was upset. My approach to these kinds of courses had worked so well for so many years, why is this professor asking me for something different?

I tried thinking of more interesting things to say in each assignment. I eliminated sentences that said obvious things or repeated previous points. I tried digging deeper into statements I was writing. Why was that event important? What were its implications? What do we still not know with certainty? Initially, my motivation was simply to improve my grade in the class. But eventually, as I engaged with the class differently, I found myself engaging in a way I hadn't with other humanities courses.

The final assignment was a presentation of a topic of our choosing. By then I was quite engaged with the coursework. I wrote about the difference between patriotism and nationalism and how each shows up in good and bad ways in American history. Growing up, I was taught to be patriotic, and I had never thought deeply about the concept. This class forced me to revisit these assumptions, which led to revisiting other assumptions. By the time I had written a first draft, instead of stretching content to fit the word count like I usually did, I found I had _too much_ content, and I needed to somehow edit it down to fit the constraints of the assignment.

By the end of the semester, I clawed my way up to an A- grade, and unlike my other courses, it really felt earned. I spent more time on this class than any of my other courses that semester, despite my other mechanical engineering courses being demanding.

Looking back on it now, this class was my first real lesson in how to think. No other professor or class had such an outsized effect on me. It was an early step in my understanding of quality, and I learned that I could actually be interested in my college education, rather than treating it like an inconvenient video game that I needed a high score in.
