I'm reading a book about bicycle fitting (_Bike Fit_ by Phil Burt). Bicycle fitting is the process of getting a bicycle to fit your body better, which is important as you do longer and longer rides.

The book introduced me to the concept of "macro-adjusters" and "micro-adjusters".

> I’m often asked how important optimising bike fit is. My most honest answer is: ‘To some, very. To others, not so much.’

For micro-adjusters, a perfectly optimized fit is essential, while macro-adjusters can adapt to large changes in bicycle fit and are not as sensitive to changes. In addition to being more sensitive, micro-adjusters are more prone to injury, which is fascinating to me. You could have two people with identical bodies and proportions, and one person can ride 20 bikes with different fits and feel fine, while the other person person can only ride 1 of the bikes comfortably.

While reading this chapter, I identified strongly with the micro-adjuster. If I move the seat forward a few millimeters, I immediately notice. If I ride a bike that is a little too big for me, I quickly get shoulder pain. Many people I know seem to be macro-adjusters. They can tolerate fits that I know would be really painful for me.

This macro/micro-adjuster concept is thought-provoking because it seems to apply far beyond just bicycle fit. It took me forever to find a hiking backpack that was comfortable for me. I have always been sensitive to ergonomic issues while working at a desk. I get shoulder pain when chopping vegetables. I am sensitive to what people say and how they say it.

Perhaps as a result, I am drawn to optimization. I like having the right tool for a given task, especially if it's something I have to do frequently. Once I have my tools dialed in (bicycle fit, office chair, keyboard), I can focus for long periods of time on the task itself (cycling, programming).

One reason I find this so interesting is that the advice someone needs in life differs greatly from person to person. I've noticed friends with seemingly painful bicycle fits, and I'll tell them what they should do to improve their fit, but they aren't in pain to begin with! They don't need my micro-adjuster advice. Similarly, an adaptive macro-adjuster might tell a sensitive micro-adjuster they just need to "get used to" the desk they are using or the bicycle they are riding, while they actually need to spend time really adjusting their setup so they can be more comfortable.
