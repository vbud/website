My wife Karishma is a product manager. We actually met working together at New Relic - I was a software engineer and she was my PM. To date she is still the best PM I ever worked with.

The other day she wrote this excellent guide to how she PMs and then shared it with me. She doesn't have a blog, and I absolutely love her approach to product management, so I thought I'd share her guide here.

Anything that can help the product and user experience is my job (sales, support, docs, etc.).

Outcomes > Outputs (read [Escaping the Build Trap](https://www.amazon.com/Escaping-Build-Trap-Effective-Management/dp/149197379X)).

Talk to customers. All the time. Especially first-time users as your product grows and becomes bulky. Always have ~5 customers you can slack or text message for instant feedback.

More intuition, data, and customer sentiment, less frameworks/process. If you can shorten (or skip) process to ship something faster, do it (and maybe come back to it after). Get out of your own way.

Rely on and enable engineers to invalidate terrible ideas and influence the product direction. Opinionated engineers that love building useful products for themselves is why I got into devtools.

Network to maintain a pulse check on how other teams in the org feel about the product â€“ the best insights can come from anywhere.

Always have opinions. Be able to list the top things that are working and not working for the business at any given time. I have opinions about the font used for menus at restaurants.

Making mistakes, then acknowledging and fixing them, is superior to not doing anything at all.

Measure a good week in terms of how much you changed the product and impacted customer experience, not so much how many documents you wrote, slides you made, or meetings you attended.

Be direct, concise, and honest in your communication. Assume good intent. Accountability is good.
