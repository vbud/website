I like the _intersection of design and engineering_ for _complex tasks_. I'll try to unpack that statement below.

_If any of this resonates with you, you might also enjoy perusing my [list of ideas](/blog/ideas)._

# Intersection of design and engineering

I like the "intersection of design and engineering" because I've spent times on both sides, sometimes holding both roles. I like thinking about the [information design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_design) and really taking the time to understand the user's goals. I've found that thinking through the design with a technical background helps me make decisions that result in more elegant code. Similarly, I've found that understanding design as an engineer helps me better inform design decisions with an understanding of what is technically possible. Code and design decisions are deeply intertwined, as all strong designers and engineers that I've met understand. In my experience, it is not possible to build great software for complex tasks without strong design and engineering collaboration. "Handoffs" between design and engineering might work for a simple website (honestly they don't even work that well here, but you can probably get away with it), but they don't work for the kind of software I like to design and build.

# Complex tasks

When I say "complex task", I mean things like:

- on-call engineer gets woken up at 3am and needs to quickly understand the root cause of a software problem
- a fighter jet pilot needs to be able to quickly understand where other planes are in the sky and what airspace they are flying into (among many other things)
- a backcountry guide needs to plan a route for an expedition in the mountains, taking into consideration weather, snow, technical difficulty, slope angle, and many other variables
- a city planner needs to plan a new bus route, taking into consideration existing routes, how many people the route serves within a half mile radius, walkability of the streets to the new bus stop, where people in this area need to commute to, and many other variables

I love designing for complex tasks because, to do it right, I need to really spend time understanding the user's goals, how they solve this problem today, and how a new or better software solution can really make their life easier. I also need to understand what is technically possible and prototype different solutions to the problem. I suppose everything I just wrote applies to most software, but for particularly complex problems, there is no perfect existing solution I can copy or modify - I have to design something really purpose-built to the problem at hand. My favorite kinds of software design problems involve lots of data and lots of interactivity, and they require deep familiarity with the problem domain.
