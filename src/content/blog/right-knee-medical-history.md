# Short version

This is as short a summary as I could make without losing any important information. Please read all of it!

- ACL tear Jan 2019
- No pain after tear, did prehab exercises prior to surgery
- ACL reconstruction surgery (BTB patellar graft) Mar 2019
- Patellofemoral pain immediately after surgery that is present to this day
  - Pain and stiffness are strongest in the last ~20ยบ of extension
  - Pain walking, particularly on flat terrain
- Started losing extension during rehab, found cyclops lesion, had it removed Dec 2019
- Constant, disciplined PT 2019-2022.
  - Tried managing my pain as patellofemoral pain. Tried to keep pain 3/10 or lower and slowly built up strength, i.e. [envelope of function](https://www.physiotutors.com/envelope-of-function/) approach.
  - Never able to restore normal function
  - Tried returning to agility/running but always ended up encountering large spikes in pain, and the movement never felt normal
  - Tried "knee-safe" activities like swimming, but the kicking was very painful for me
- Kaiser surgeons told me that long-term, unresolvable patellofemoral pain is possible with any ACL surgery, and more likely with my graft choice.
  - In my surgeries and MRIs, Kaiser PTs and surgeons noted cartilage wear behind my patella, suggested that was the cause of pain
- I became disillusioned with Kaiser, switched to Anthem to gain access to a broader set of doctors and institutions
  - Several surgeons point out the cartilage wear in my MRIs and suggested patellar MACI
- MACI harvest Aug 2022, implantation Sep 2023
- Was quickly evident that MACI had no impact on my pain, experienced same pain and stiffness as I have since initial ACL surgery
- Post-MACI PT, following envelope of function approach again
  - Unfortunately, pain levels continue to increase
- Paid out-of-pocket for an MRI of my good knee
  - Learned that I have the same cartilage wear in the same location on my good knee, which does not present with any pain
- Pain near extension worsened 2024-2025 to the point where even walking can be very painful
- Renewed search for an orthopedic doctor who could help me figure out what is going on, new x-ray and MRI performed
  - MRI report notes anterior placement of graft, bowing of graft, and fat pad impingement due to the graft location
  - One surgeon suggests ACL revision to resolve poor graft placement and impingement
- Anterior ACL graft placement diagnosis appears to correlate much better than a generic patellofemoral pain diagnosis
  - Pain in the last ~20ยบ of extension is graft and/or fat pad impingement
  - I've never had the common symptoms of B2B patellar graft patellofemoral pain, like pain kneeling or in deep flexion
  - Cyclops lesions are a common complication caused by anterior graft placement
  - Anterior shifting of tibia relative to femur explains visual difference between my two legs
- As of May 2025, I am getting more opinions from other surgeons to verify that ACL revision is the right course of action

# Full version

I tore my ACL skiing in January 2019. ACL reconstruction surgery was soon scheduled for March 2019 at Kaiser in San Francisco. For the 2 months before the surgery, I did "prehab" to keep the knee and leg strong. I was pain free at this time.

I was given a choice between a hamstring graft and a BTB patellar graft. The surgeon advised me to do the BTB patellar graft because it is the "gold standard" and the graft is stronger than the hamstring graft, and hence more resistant to re-tear.

As soon as I started PT exercises after my ACLR surgery, I started experiencing pain and stiffness that has stayed with me to this day. The pain presents under and slightly below my patella, and it is strongest in the ~20ยบ arc leading up to full knee extension. Consequently, it is easy to trigger with simple PT exercises like quad sets and banded terminal knee extensions. Kaiser PTs encouraged me to "push through the pain", but it was clear my experience was different than the others in my group PT sessions. The pain was blocking me from being able to perform movements correctly.

After initially regaining extension, I started to lose extension a few months into PT. Because of this and the strong patellofemoral pain I was experiencing, while my rehab stalled. After another MRI, we discovered that a cyclops lesion had developed. Another surgery was performed in December 2019, after which I regained extension. The hope was that this, combined with some debridement, would reduce pain, but it did not.

I spoke with several different surgeons at Kaiser about my situation, and they all said 1) that BTB patellar graft can result in unresolvable patellofemoral pain and 2) given my cartilage damage, I could consider a cartilage restoration surgery like OATS.

Disappointed with the quality of Kaiser's PT department and skeptical that more surgery would fix my problems, I left Kaiser to gain access to a broader set of institutions, PTs, and doctors. I found some PTs who treated my condition as they would general patellofemoral pain, which allowed me to restore some strength and function. This [envelope of function](https://www.physiotutors.com/envelope-of-function/) approach instructed me to keep pain 3/10 or below and slowly build up strength while avoiding any movements that cause spikes in pain. This allowed me to regain a lot of muscle mass, and it also made it possible to return to hiking and cycling. These activities were still not pain free, but I could do them at a seemingly manageable low level of pain.

I tried reintroducing running at multiple points, but it would always lead to large spikes in pain that took weeks to recover from. Over time, my pain levels kept increasing with activities like hiking and weightlifting. I had an MRI done and found that the cartilage damage to my patella had expanded to become a 2cm defect. I had several different surgeons look at this MRI (Brian Gilmer, Drew Lansdown, and Ken Akizuki), and all 3 mentioned MACI as an alternative to OATS for cartilage restoration.

With pain worsening, I decided I needed to try another surgery, and it seemed like I had broad consensus that MACI was worth a try. (Aside: I learned recently that not all surgeons are as optimistic about MACI's effectiveness, particularly for a large patellar defect, so it seems I just had a sample of surgeons biased toward MACI.) I had the MACI graft implanted in Sep 2023.

A few months into the PT for MACI, it became clear that it did not have any impact on the pain. All the same exercises involving terminal knee extension still hurt. Walking on flat surfaces still hurt. Discouraged but still determined, I spent the following year rehabbing using the same envelope of function approach as before.

Given all the focus on cartilage, my PT suggested that I could pay out-of-pocket for an MRI of my good knee to get a better idea of the state of the cartilage in my good knee as a baseline. This ended up being very interesting - the MRI showed that I have similar cartilage damage in the same area on my good knee. Between the MACI and this MRI, I became quite skeptical that cartilage damage is the cause of my pain, since cartilage damage does not always present with pain.

In March 2025, I was now 1.5 years since the MACI surgery. The envelope of function PT approach had allowed me to return to some cycling and hiking, but pain levels were higher than before. PT exercises that were not painful in 2024 started becoming painful. Walking on flat surfaces is much more painful that it used to be, sometimes even 6/10 pain, which is very difficult to live with. With some reluctance, I decided I need to talk to orthopedic doctors. I wanted a fresh perspective, so I set up appointments with doctors and surgeons I haven't spoken to before. An x-ray and MRI were performed.

This [MRI report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eDwAQJrFVT4gyqly6RZ0yNJOL8vdAySi/view?usp=sharing) contained some new findings:

1. the tibial tunnel of the graft is positioned anterior to Blumensaat line
2. the ACL graft is bowing
3. evidence of fat pad impingement

As of May 2025, I am in the process of talking to surgeons about my situation. One surgeon (Keith Chan at California Pacific Orthopaedics), upon seeing the MRI and understanding that I've already tried managing it conservatively, suggested ACL revision. Keith also said that the MACI surgery I underwent was a "long shot" for treating my pain.

The anterior placement of the graft is new information to me, and initially reading about it line up with my lived experience and symptoms much better than general post-B2B graft patellofemoral pain. Namely:

- I don't have pain kneeling on the ground or in deep flexion as is often the case with this type of pain.
- I have pain in that last ~20ยบ of knee extension, which isn't really a feature of general patellofemoral pain.
- Cyclops lesions are a common complication of overly anterior ACL graft placement.
- My right tibia is clearly anterior of its normal position if you look at my two legs side-by-side.

I'm seeing more surgeons at UCSF and Stanford over the coming weeks.
